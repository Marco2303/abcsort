# abcsort

This software is intended for sorting text format files.

Work in progress...

This is my first work in C, so the software writing may not be of good quality.
As often happens when learning new programming languages, many pieces of code are introduced during the learning process, and the application, as in this case, suffers from the resulting structural engineering issues.
Don't judge me for this.
